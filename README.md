## ❓ What is a DDoS Attack?

A **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)** attack floods a server or network with traffic to exhaust its resources and make it unavailable to legitimate users.

Think of it like a traffic jam caused by thousands of fake cars blocking a highway, so real drivers can’t get through.
